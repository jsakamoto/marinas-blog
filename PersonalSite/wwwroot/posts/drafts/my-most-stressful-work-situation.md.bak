The most stressful time, for me, was my employment during the pandemic.

I was the sole software developer working for a lone entrepreneur with the goal of building an e-commerce solution from scratch. It was a fun creative experience - I learned a lot about product development and marketing. But the worst part was that the person that I worked for had some personality issues.

He was charismatic at first and very strict. Very early it became somewhat apparent that he was very rude, demanding, and threatening to people. He often shifted the blame onto others. It appeared to me that he was the traumatized type. He slowly told me his sad story - his version of it. I was a bit too empathetic to him. Though, still a bit skeptical about him and his grand goals.

I was overall happy that I had this close creative collaboration with someone, and for having the freedom to solve the technical stuff the way I wanted. But there were times when I wanted to stop him from getting too many ideas - so that he did not have me work for him for free. And I did not want to give up my own creative endeavours for false promises.

He was often very self-centered with his ideas and plans. It made me very cautious.

As the customers were on him for not delivering on his promsies, stressing him, he pushed me. I got stressed myself by struggling to deliver features to production in just a few days, or even in just hours. He really expected me to work overtime.

I later tried to strictly separate work from private life. Not to hang out with him too much, just because of how he was. That was especially important to me as a single person working from home during the pandemic. The lines so often get blurred.

When I criticized the quality of what I produced I got yelled at for 15-20 minutes straight, without interruption. It was a lecture. And he disliked being interrupted by other people so much that he became even more serious. He was very angy - I weeped in front of the web camera in our Teams calls. After the storm he usually calmed down, and he got somewhat composed again.

This behavior repeated itself during the 2 years that I worked for him.

I won't deny that I made mistakes, but how he treated me as an employee in that instance was toxic.

I filed my period of notice and reported sick to not have to deal with him before exit. He would have pushed me even more.

The break up felt like a breaking up from a bad relationship. We had bonded and I felt so awful. At the same time he has contacted the labor union and making bold claims without real legal grounds in an attempt to keep me from leaving. Claiming his responsibility to deliver to customer. It did not work, of course.

I finally got free, but with lasting effects on my self confidence due to the emotional trauma and stress.

This event in my history, affected my social interactions after that, it still continues to do so.

It has been a year now (as of September 2022) since I got free from this. And it has really gotten me to think about my health.

The time after, in-between jobs, I used my introverted energy to research architecture, microservices, distributed monoliths and so on. Spending some time thinking, exploring, coding. I produced a couple of blog posts about that. They can be read here on this blog.
