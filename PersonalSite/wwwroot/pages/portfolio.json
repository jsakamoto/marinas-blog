            "description": "Conceptual app for managing a consultancy business - from sales to running a project.\n\nIt was conceived from the idea of building my own all-in-one intranet application for managing a consultancy company. I added my existing \"TimeReport\" project, I and revised the \"Showroom\" (Resum√© service) project. From there it continued to evolve.\n\nIt now combines multiple projects (Product Catalog, Showroom, TimeReport, Finance App etc.) in one integrated solution. Some parts are in an early and unfinished state; like the Orders, HR, and Warehouse parts.\n\nThis project acts as a playground for exploring Software Architecture and Domain-driven design patterns. Learning how to model complex domains that interact with each other.\n\nUses MudBlazor for a Material Design look and feel.",
