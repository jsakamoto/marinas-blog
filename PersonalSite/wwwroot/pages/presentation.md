I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

I am goal-oriented. I like to get into the details to get that deeper understanding of the subject at hand. You could say that I'm a geek.

As a person, I would describe myself as positive and social. Easy going. Enthusiastic about learning new stuff, and gaining new perspectives and understanding of the world around me. Thoughtful and reflecting on whatever crosses my mind. 

My career kicked off in 2014, when I was brought on a project [building an app for emergency response services](/blog/building-software-for-emergency-response). That later landed me a position as System developer. Since then I have worked both as a full-time employee and as a consultant for various companies.

I have experience both from working on user-focused applications, and on medium to large enterprise systems. I have contributed to software projects in a number of industries, such as medical equipment, physical security, food processing, and housing. I also have worked on an enterprise resource system. 

I take a holistic perspective on software development. My motivation is in understanding the purpose of what I am doing and how it helps people. What I contribute with is my skills, insights, and knowledge from previous business domains and places that I have worked in.

Software design is one of my areas of interest. I also care about User Experience (UX). I believe that is important to focus on Use Cases when building great software that users value.

I thrive in an environment in which there is commitment and motivation to the task at hand, as well as openness to new ideas and perspectives. I do believe that it is important for everyone to feel included and to be heard.

My competence lies mainly in development on the .NET platform - from building desktop apps and developing services as part of bigger systems. I have also been doing Web development in a number of projects that used JavaScript/TypeScript and React. Besides that, I have also used and explored a number of other technologies. I am eager to learn new things

I like spending time working on [my own projects](/portfolio), from which I learn a lot about the ins and outs of building software, concerning both the technical side and User Experience (UX). I enjoy working from use cases and researching the domains. Thinking about how I could improve something. As a creative person, I find the activity itself stimulating and fun. 

I am also active in the software development community on the Internet, where I participate in the discussions, and share knowledge with others.

## Me, beyond that

I am a picky coffee lover who likes to grind their own beans.

Since way back, I enjoy listening to foreign music, learning the languages and cultures. I also travel when I get the opportunity. My main interest has been the Spanish, Italian, and Hindi/Urdu cultural spheres. I easily pick up the basics of languages. So when I meet native-speakers they often get surprised about how much I know about their cultures.

Now and then, I go out in the country-side to spend some time with my family. I have two wonderful nieces, and a nephew whom I all love so much.

I enjoy taking walks in beautiful nature, with or without company. For me, when I'm alone is the time to relax, to reflect, and to re-focus my mind and energy. 

During my last vacation, I got into making cocktails from being inspired by videos. Since then I have made and enjoyed a number of Sours and other kinds of drinks - also making them for others. 

My favorite cocktail at the moment is [Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita). I enjoy it with two slices of Jalapeño which give it a spicy edge. Now and then, I also enjoy a classic ["Old Fashioned"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)).
