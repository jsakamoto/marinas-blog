I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

I would describe myself as a positive and social person. Thoughtful and reflecting on whatever comes to my mind. I am always open to new perspectives.

My career kicked off in 2014, when I was brought on a project building an app for emergency response services. That later landed me a position as a System developer. Since then I have been both a full-time employee and a consultant for various companies. 

From my time in the industry, I have experience both from working on user-focused applications, and on medium to large enterprise systems - both the front end and the back end.

My competence is mainly in development using C#/.NET - both building desktop apps and services (backends). I have also been doing Web development in a number of projects that used JavaScript/TypeScript and React.

As a consultant, I have contributed to software projects in a number of industries, such as medical equipment, physical security, food processing, and housing. I have also developed an e-commerce solution. 

I take a holistic perspective on things. My motivation is in understanding the purpose of what I am doing and how it helps people. To seek collaboration with them in order to find out their needs, discover the use cases, and how I can fulfill them.

When people get to know me, they often notice that I have a strong commitment. I care about the product that I am working on. And I see opportunities and ways to improve both the product and our ways of working as a team. To me it is important to have an engaging, honest, and constructive discussion in which everyone feels included.

I have a creative urge that drives me. I like to do stuff because it is stimulating and fun. And in the process, I earn new knowledge and perspective.
