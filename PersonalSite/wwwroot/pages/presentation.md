I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

I would describe myself as a positive and social person. Enthusiastic about learning new stuff, and gaining new perspectives and understanding of the world around me. Thoughtful and reflecting on whatever crosses my mind. You would probably say that I'm a geek.

My career kicked off in 2014, when I was brought on a project [building an app for emergency response services](/blog/building-software-for-emergency-response). That later landed me a position as System developer. Since then I have worked both as a full-time employee and as a consultant for various companies.


From my time in the industry, I have experience both from working on user-focused applications, and on medium to large enterprise systems - both at the front end and the back end. I have contributed to software projects in a number of industries, such as medical equipment, physical security, food processing, and housing. I also have worked on an enterprise resource system. 

My competence is mainly in development using C#/.NET - from building desktop apps and developing services as part of bigger systems. I have also been doing Web development in a number of projects that used JavaScript/TypeScript and React. Besides that, I gain a lot of knowledge from [my own projects](/portfolio) in which I explore technologies and new ways to build solutions.

I take a holistic perspective on things. My motivation is in understanding the purpose of what I am doing and how it helps people. To seek collaboration with them in order to find out their needs and how I can fulfill them.

When people get to know me, they often notice that I have a strong commitment. I care about the product that I am working on. And I see opportunities and ways to improve both the product and our ways of working as a team. To me it is important to have an engaging, honest, and constructive discussion in which everyone feels included. That is how we truly tackle problems.

I have a creative urge that drives me. I like to do stuff because it is stimulating and fun. And in the process, I gain new knowledge and perspective
