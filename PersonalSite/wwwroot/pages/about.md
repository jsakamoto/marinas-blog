I'm as Software developer who is based in [Malmö, Sweden](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Malmö/@55.5702455,12.9457618,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465305a574c491ff:0xd3a905dfbd4888e5!8m2!3d55.604981!4d13.003822?hl=en).

I have been programming since 2007. My interest back then was to figure out how it all works. Since then I have been learning a lot about software engineering, both professionally and in my free time.

Words that describe me well as a person are: Creativity, Curiousity, and Craftsmanship.

My motivation is understanding the value that my work brings to customers - understanding the product and task at hand. Collaborating with other creative people to build innovative software experiences. And learning and having fun together! You could say that I'm goal-oriented.

Most of the time I have worked as a consultant serving customers in various businesses as part of teams on-site.

I’ve been across the entire technology stack ("full stack") in several projects. Some frontend technologies that I have been working with are React and Blazor. On the backend, using both C#/.NET and JavaScript/NodeJS.

I'm a creative person and I enjoy working on my own projects. I share some of them on GitHub and in my video portfolio on YouTube.

My experiences and skills are listed my [résumé](/resume).
