I'm a Software developer who is based in [Malm√∂, Sweden](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Malm√∂/@55.5702455,12.9457618,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465305a574c491ff:0xd3a905dfbd4888e5!8m2!3d55.604981!4d13.003822?hl=en).

I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

Some of my interests are taking walks in beautiful nature, philosophizing while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and making tasty cocktails.

My favorite cocktail at the moment is [Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita). I enjoy it with two slices of Jalape√±o which give it a spicy edge. Now and then, I also enjoy a classic ["Old Fashioned"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)).

Btw. I'm a cat person.

Here is a more extensive [presentation](/presentation) of myself.
