I'm a Software developer who is based in [Malm√∂, Sweden](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Malm√∂/@55.5702455,12.9457618,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465305a574c491ff:0xd3a905dfbd4888e5!8m2!3d55.604981!4d13.003822?hl=en).

I have been coding since 2007. Since then, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

Some of my other interests are taking walks in beautiful nature, philosophizing while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and making tasty cocktails. üòä

My favorite cocktail at the moment is [Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita). I enjoy it with two slices of Jalape√±o which give it a spicy edge. Now and then, I also enjoy a classic ["Old Fashioned"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)).
