I'm as Software developer who is based in [Malmö, Sweden](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Malmö/@55.5702455,12.9457618,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465305a574c491ff:0xd3a905dfbd4888e5!8m2!3d55.604981!4d13.003822?hl=en).

I have been programming since 2007. My interest back then was to figure out how it all works. Since then I have been learning a lot about software engineering, both professionally and in my free time.

My career began back in 2014, when I was working as a software developer for a local company that provided Internet and IT services. After that I went into consulting, where I got to experience software development at various companies and in many fields. I have maninly been working with technologies such as .NET and Web.

I'm driven by creativity and a desire to share what I have learned with others. You can see what I have been up to in my [portfolio](/portfolio) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/marinasundstrom).

My experiences and skills are listed in [resume](/resume).

## My Views on Software Development

I believe that the purpose of software is to improve people's lives. As software developers we are empowering people, giving them tools, and ways to connect with each other. We are making people more productive. 

Software development is a collaborative process that brings together people of different competences and backgrounds. The user has an idea of what they want to achieve with the software. The domain expert knows what the software should do. The software developer has the technical skills to build the software. They all have to interact in order for the software to come about.

I also believe that it is important to have the User - their needs and experiences - in mind in order to build great software. The questions I ask myself are: Would I enjoy using the software that I build? How could I do it differently? 

There is always something to improve and to make even better.
